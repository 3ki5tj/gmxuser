mhex README
=============

mhex is an example for using multiple histogram method to process trajectory 
generated by md1 or higher versions.  Basically we can recover equilibrium 
thermodynamics at the room temperature.  
In the example, we simply compute a histogram for the radius of gyration.

How to compile
===============
1. put mhex.c and zeutil.h to src/kernel of GROMACS
2. modify Makefile.am
   2.a  append `mhex' after a list file following `bin_PROGRAMS = '
   2.b  add a line
       mhex_SOURCES = mhex.c
3. run automake and make

How to run
============
Requirements

0. a topology file under the running directory
   default name is naked.tpr, use -s to change
1. a ZE file under the running directory
   default name is ZE, use -z to change
2. individual trajectories arranged in a sequence of sub-directories as
    data1, data2, ...
3. a TRACE file in each dataXXX subdirectory,
   the default name is TRACE, use -t to change
4. a trajectory file in each dataXXX subdirectory, 
   whose default name is fit.xtc, use -f to change
   the peridoic boundary condition must be removed in this .xtc file

A typical run is like:

  mhex -s naked.tpr -z ZE -T 300.0

-T: the desired temperature in K, usually the room temperature
To see more options, type
   mhex -h


After the run, you should have a file "out.txt" under the current directory.
To view the result in gnuplot, type
  gnuplot
  (in gnuplot)
  plot "out.txt"
