### do_ewald()

The Fourier sum

phi(k) = exp(-k^2/(4*sig^2))/k^2

sig: ewaldcoeff (or fr->ewaldcoeff_q)

larger sig: needs shorter real-space cutoff
smaller sig: needs fewer k in need


This function is called by `do_force_lowlevel()`
defined in `force.c`



### calc_ewaldcoeff_q()

Compute `sig` such that
```
erfc(sig*rc) < tol
```

rc: `ir->rcoulomb`
tol: `ir->ewald_rtol`

The smaller `rc`, smaller `tol`, requires a larger `sig`.
A larger `sig`, more `k` Fourier-space vectors is needed.
