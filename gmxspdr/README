GROMACS engine fetcher gmxspdr.py
=================================

Overview
--------
The program grabs several core GROMACS files,
  and writes a self-contained C file, which can be
  compiled to an independent engine.
Optionally, it reads an input template file `foo.h',
  and then outputs `mdfoo.c', in which the functional
  tags, such as $MDRUN_C are replaced by the relevant
  functions in the corresponding GROMACS source code
  (in this case `mdrun.c').


Quick usage
------------
Put a symbolic link fo the script under the directory
  GROMACS 4/4.5 src/kernel
Then run
  python ./gmxspdr.py



File structure
--------------
gmxspdr.py
 |
 +--ccmdxv45.py   specific modifications to various
 |   |            GROMACS source files
 |   |
 |   +--ccgmx.py  common code changes to GROMACS
 |       |        such as getting the version, and removing
 |       |        useless code like thanx()
 |       |
 |       +--cc.py generic code changes, such as adding,
 |                removing and substituting a line/block
 |
 +--ccaux.py:     write auxiliary code

cspacer.py        the code beautifier called in cc.py
                  it can be missing however


* the v4.0 versions are independent of the v4.5 versions
* atspider.py is attached here for compatibility
    (it, however, now depends on cc.py and ccgmx.py)



Classes
---------------
* CC:       generic code changer (cc.py)
            e.g., remove a line, find a code block, etc.
* CCGMX:    common changes for GROMACS, based on CC (ccgmx.py)
