GROMACS code fetcher gmxspdr.py
=================================


Overview
--------
The program grabs several core GROMACS files,
  and writes a self-contained C file, which can be
  compiled to an independent engine.
Optionally, it reads an input template file `foo.h',
  and then outputs `mdfoo.c', in which the functional
  tags, such as $MDRUN_C are replaced by the relevant
  functions in the corresponding GROMACS source code
  (in this case `mdrun.c').

The advantage of writing a separate GROMACS engine
  is that it won't pollute the official version,
  or make the code-base bloat.
The aim of the project is to write a skeleton GROMACS code
  automatically.  The code should be work for small changes
  made in the official versions of the GROMACS.
  (however, both GROMACS v4.5 and v4.0 are quite stable now.)

A few additional functions inserted to the template are ANSI C;
  they do not depend on "zcom.h"


Quick usage
------------
Put a symbolic link of the script under the directory

  GROMACS 4/4.5 src/kernel

Then run

  python ./gmxspdr.py

Or, if there is a template, say `foo.h'

  python ./gmxspdr.py foo.h

The `.h' on the command line can be omitted.



Files
--------------
gmxspdr.py
 |
 +--ccmdxv45.py   specific modifications to various
     |            GROMACS source files
     |
     +--ccgmx.py  common code changes to GROMACS
         |        such as getting the version, and removing
         |        useless code like thanx()
         |
         +--cc.py generic code changes, such as adding,
                  removing and substituting a line/block

ccutil.py         standalone helper functions

cspacer.py        the code beautifiers called in ccutil.py
cindent.py        they can be missing however


* the v4.0 versions are independent of the v4.5 versions
* the old script atspider.py is attached here for compatibility



Classes
---------------
* CC:       generic code changer (cc.py)
            e.g., remove a line, find a code block, etc.
* CCGMX:    common changes for GROMACS, based on CC (ccgmx.py)
