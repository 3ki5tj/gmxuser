mdX.c can be
  created by md_t.c with a version specialization by genver.py
  alternately created by spider.py

mdXutil.h can be
  created by md_tutil.h with version specialization by genver.py

mdXcore.h can be
  created by md_tcore.h with version specialization by genver.py
     created by md_tcore.0.h with object generation

zcom.h can also be
  zcom1.h zcom2.h

o version specialization is performed by genver.py
  which can be run individually or through updmd.py

o og.py generates XXX.0.h --> XXX.h
  an expanded version with automatic functions are generate from .0.h templates
  og.py is also called by updmd.py
  og.py is in ~/work/common/objgen/
  a direct call looks like this
    og.py XXX.h


*******************************************************************************

md1.c  tempering simulation
md2.c  high temperature biased tempering

zcom.h common routines,

mb[0-9].h integral identity generate from the template mb_t.h


Tools (toys)
==============
amberize
        o make a regular PDB more friendly to ffamber
        o for GROMACS 4.0 only, 4.5 has its only AMBER support

mkspx
        o make spirial like beta conformation from an amino acid sequence

xdihs
        o analyse (backbone) dihedral distribution

mqsub
        o job submission tool

dihmb
        o display dihedral angle information for .xtc & other format
        o an example of reading .xtc file

md2conv (for md2 preparation run)
        o tool for separating peaks from potential of mean force
          and adjust their relative proportions

spbmb
        o multiple-bin estimator for two independent dihedral distributions
        o read/write spb.mb

iibb (formerly bbmb)
        o multiple-bin estimator for joint distribution of the two dihedrals
        o utility

mhex
        o example of using multiple-histogram method
        o not using zcom.h
        o oldver/egxtc.c a further simplification

dihmb1
        o overall phi/psi dihedral distribution
        o dihderal profile

ncontact
        o contact number

vdist
        o chiral distribution, measured from vertical distance from helix C to the plane of helices A and B
        o helix distance

clusmb
        o clustering program

mhidx
        o generate a list of frames pertinent to 300K

rmsdis
        o compute 300K RMSD distribution from the native

rmsfilter
        o filter 300K frames with rmsd in (rmsd_min, rmsd_max)

Code management
============================
GNUmakefile
  updmd.py
    genver.py
    zcompick.py
    og.py

GNUmakefile
        o a fake makefile that helps to compile code at other VPATH directories
        o calls updmd.py

updmd.py
        o master code manager for md1, md2, ...
        o calls genver.py to manage md1.c, md2.c
        o calls zcompick.py to manage zcom1.c, zcom2.c
        o calls og.py (through command line) to convert *.0.h to *.h
          generate auto functions, e.g., md2spb.0.h --> md2spb.h

genver.py
        o version specialization from a template
        o converts abc_t.h to abc1.h
        o depending on flags like #if ABC_VER == 0
        o md_t.c to md1.c, md2.c, ...

zcompick.py
        o creates zcom1.h, zcom2.h from zcom.h

md1_pack
        o creates a package for md1
