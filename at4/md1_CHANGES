o tentatively migrate code to the 4.5 branch
o we now use a simplified zcom.c, or zcom1.c to avoid unnecessary warnings
o tentatively support the threads
o create symbolic links zcom1.h, md1core.h to zcom1.c, and md1core.c.
  only the former will be packed in the distribution.
  Makefile.am can thus be simplified.
