Accelerated tempering (md1) README
=====================================


`md1' is a program for accelerated tempering based on an integral identity.
It is a stand-alone program independent of mdrun (the main engine of GROMACS).
In this sense, it acts more like a plugin.
The code is based on the current stable version of GROMACS 4.0.7 with a few
more recent patches from the git repository.

The user interface (command line options, input files) of `md1' is mostly
identical to that of `mdrun'.
However, it can only do molecular dynamics, not energy minimization,
normal modes, free energy, as the latter functions are removed for simplicity.


INSTALL
---------------------------

First you need to download and unzip GROAMCS to a directory, which
will be refered to as GROMACS_ROOT in the follows.
Then copy all the .c and .h files to GROMACS_ROOT/src/kernel/.

You also need to change makefiles. There are two ways to do so.

1. The lazy way
   If your source code tree is identical to the official version,
   then simply copy Makefile.am and Makefile.in in the package to
   GROMACS_SOURCE_ROOT/src/kernel. But make sure you make a copy
   of the original files!

2. Change makefiles manually
   If you've ever changed the source code tree, this is the recommended
   way of changing makefiles.
   You need to have GNU autotools installed.

   Modify `Makefile.am' under the same directory as follows:
    2A. Add md1 to bin_PROGRAMS
    2B. Add the following two lines
          md1_SOURCES = md1.c
          md1.$(OBJEXT): md1core.h mb1.h zcom1.h
    2C. Run autotools,
        If you can find a script called `bootstrap' under GROMACS_SOURCE_ROOT
        just run the script. Otherwise, try:
          automake && autoconf
        If it again fails, run
          aclocal && acheader && automake && autoconf

After that, goto GROMACS_SOURCE_ROOT and enter
  ./configure and make.


How to run md1
---------------------------

Generally, md1 behaves similarly to mdrun.  The only difference is that
it requires a configuration file, at.cfg, for additional information
for tempering, such as the temperature range, and window size for
using the integral identities.  The name of the file (at.cfg) can be
changed through the command line option "-at your_file.cfg".
See the next section for how to write such a file.

In addition to the configuration file, you need to prepare a topology
(.tpr file) acceptable by mdrun, then simply change the command
from mdrun to md1.

At the end of a simulation, you will have a few output files
in addition to the standard GROMACS ones.

  mb.av:                binary, accumulated data about the potential energy.
  mbav_file             mbav_file is the corresponding file name in configuration
                        file (at.cfg).
                        To change the default file name, e.g. to mbav.bin, add a line
                            mbav_file=mbav.bin

  hist.bin:             binary, histogram-like data of the energy histograms
  ehist_file

  MTSEED:               random number generator (RNG) state for resuming a run.
  rng_file              The RNG is independent of GROMACS's own RNG.

  TRACE:                text, the instantaneous temperature, energy, etc, saved at
  trace_file            a regular interval (nsttrace in at.cfg)

  ZE:                   text, the calculated the partition function (column 2),
  ze_file               average energy (column 3 & 5) as a function of the reciprocal
                        temperature beta (column 1).

  HMB:                  text, reconstructed energy histograms at a few typical temperatures.
  ehist_mbin_file

You can continue a run starting from a checkpoint using the -cpi option.
In this case, also make sure the average file `mb.av', the energy histogram
file `hist.bin' (if energy histogram is enabled) and the random number generator
state `MTSEED' from the previous run are under the current running directory or can be
reached by the corresponding paths provided by mbav_file, ehist_file and rng_file.

ZE and HMB are not essential.  They are produced regularly to help user
check the simulation results.


Configuration file at.cfg
---------------------------

at.cfg is independent of the standard .mdp of GROMACS. Because in this way,
it can be reused in other simulations (in our case, model systems).

Normally at.cfg should be placed under the directory where you run the program.
When the program starts running, it will first try to read information
from at.cfg. If it is absent, the program simply quits.  Alternatively,
you can supply a configuration file path by passing command line option
`-at xxx.cfg' to md1.  For example, by the following command

  md1 -s foo.tpr -at path/to/your.cfg

The program md1 will use the configuration file path/to/your.cfg instead
of the default at.cfg under the current running directory.

The format of the file is a collection of straightforward assignments

   variable=value

For example,

    T0=400

means that the variable T0 (the thermostat temperature) is 400K.
Unless specified otherwise, the GROMACS units are assumed
(temperature: K, length: nm, time: ps).

at.cfg adopts a free-style format:
o  You can add spaces before and/or after `='.
o  Blank lines and spaces before the variable are ignored.
o  Semicolon `;' is used to start comments.

Thus, a line like

   T0 =   400.0 ; the thermostat temperature

is equivalent to

   T0=400

Most variables in the configuration file share the names as those in the source code.
You might want to inspect the source code for their precise meaning.
Here are a few most important ones,

1. The temperature range is expressed by the reciprocal temperature
   beta = 1.0/(kB T), where kB is the Boltzmann constant.

  beta_min=0.200
  beta_max=0.410

  In GROMACS, the Boltzmann constant is 0.008314511212... .
  Thus beta=0.2 corresponds to roughly 600K, while
  beta=0.405 is roughly 300K (i.e., kT = 2.5 kJ / mol).

2. The temperature bin size,

  beta_del=0.0002

  This is value used to perform integral identity, 0.0002 is proper for
  an explicit solvent system 3000~4000 water molecules.  You might
  need to reduce this value for larger systems, or increase the value for
  smaller systems.

  A smaller bin size means more memory and a little more computational
  effort to loop over bins. Usually they are not a big problem.

3. The thermostat temperature

  T0=400

  In the code, we scale the instantaneous force instead of the temperature
  to achieve tempering.
  In other words, we only apply tempering to the potential energy
  part of the partition function.

  Z = sum exp(- beta E)
    = sum exp{ -beta0 [(beta/beta0) E] }

  In this way, we can keep the thermostat temperature constant (the
  velocities are also not scaled).

4. The generalized ensemble is specified by a weighting function w(beta).
  Usually, for an explicit solvent simulation, w(beta) being simply
  proportional to beta^(-factor), is sufficient, where `factor' is
  specified by

  ensemble_factor=1.0

  Theoretically, the optimal value for the ensemble factor should be 0.5
  for an explicit solvent simulation (see the paper). A larger value biases
  the ensemble toward the high temperature (hotter) end.

  Now for implicit solvent simulation, you might want to focus
  on a particular temperature, (around the expected melting temperature).
  In this case, we *experimentally*
  provide a modulation to the weighting function

    w(beta) ~ beta^(-f) {1+ A*exp[-(1/2) (beta-b_C)^2/sigma^2 ]}

  the three parameters A, b_C and sigma correspond to
  ensemble_amp, ensemble_focus  and ensemble_dbeta, respectively.
  However, this is still an experimental code and not fully tested.

5. Integral identity parameters.  They share a prefix `mbest_'
  because they are called Multiple-Bin ESTimators initially.

  mbest_mbin_mode=1
  mbest_delta_lnT=0.03

  The two parameters determine how a temperature window (beta_-, beta_+)
  is drawn for a particular temperature beta.

  In mbest_mbin_mode 0:
    you need to specify mbest_delta_beta,
    beta_- = beta – mbest_delta_beta
    beta_+ = beta + mbest_delta_beta

  In mbest_mbin_mode 1:
    you need to specify mbest_delta_lnT,
    beta_- = beta exp(- mbest_delta_lnT)
    beta_+ = beta exp(+ mbest_delta_lnT)

  In mbest_mbin_mode 2:
    you need to specify mbest_delta_kT,
    1.0/beta_- = 1.0/beta + mbest_delta_kT
    1.0/beta_+ = 1.0/beta - mbest_delta_kT

  We usually choose mode 1, since it gives high a temperature a wider window,
  but not too much.

  ------

   mbest_order=1
   mbest_regularize=2
   mbest_fracmin=0

   these are technical parameters: the first one specifies the order of the
   auxiliary function phi(beta), see the paper; the second request a bin
   average first and then window average; the third is the minimal of a+/a-.

6. The adaptive tempering parameters
  shrinkamp=0.10
  shrink_mbin_adjust=1
  shrink0=0.01
  shrinkmin=0

  shrinkamp is the magnitude of adaptive averaging,
  the C_gamma in the paper, shouldn be around 0.1.
  The instantaneous damping factor is calculated as
    gamma = 1 - shrinkamp/ t,
  where t is proportional to the number of simulation steps.
  A larger shrinkamp encourages a fast random walk in the temperature
  space, however, it leads to a slower convergence in terms of
  thermodynamics.

  shrink_mbin_adjust means adjusting the magnitude according to
  the temperature window used in the integral identity.

  shrink0 is the maximal allowable magnitude, i.e., the minimal
  damping factor gamma (as in the paper) is 1-shrink0

  shrinkmin is lower limit of 1-gamma. Usually, we set it to zero,
  so we can continuously improve convergence.  And ultimately the
  simulation becomes an optimized simulated tempering.  However, if
  you want the system move faster than an equilibrium sampling,
  you can set shrinkmin to a small value, such as 1e-8~1e-6.

7. Energy histograms settings.
  If you do not need energy histogram, simply set ehist_mode=0 to disable it.
  When it is used, the following is a typical setup.

  ehist_mode=1
  ehist_skip=20
  ehist_min=-126000
  ehist_max=-86000
  ehist_del=20
  ehist_mbin_mode=1
  ehist_delta_lnT=0.01 (or ehist_delta_beta or ehist_delta_kT)

  ehist_mode: 0 off, 1 on
  ehist_skip: when writing a text file for energy distributions, skip this
              number of temperatures before proceeding to the next one.
  ehist_min/ehist_max: the energy range (system dependent!)
  ehist_del: the energy bin size
  ehist_mbin_mode/ehist_delta_lnT: similar to mbest_mbin_mode/mbest_delta_lnT
    but for energy histograms


8. Other parameters

  nsttrace=1000

  how often to write a TRACE (current temperature, energy, etc. …)
  It is recommended to be set to the same as nstxtcout (or nstxout) in .mdp file.
  In this way, quantities in TRACE will match frames in the saved trajectories.

  mbav_binary=1

  To save accumulated data in binary format (recommended).
  However, it means that

  nstav=1000000
  nsthist=1000000

  How often to save data, no need to be very often, unless you are impatient.
  nstav is for `mb.av' and `ZE', nsthist is for `hist.bin' and `HMB'.
