 *  mdgo.c
 *  mdgoutil.h
 *  mdgocore.0.h


Notes
~~~~~
 *  mdgo.c and mdgoutil.h are very similar to the generated file md1.c and md1util.h

 *  mdgocore.h is generated by og.py, and it is not under source control
    but we put the GROMACS 4.5 version here and 
    put a link under gromacs45/src/kernel
    such that each overwrite will only change
