Single executable
==================

All tools are merged to a single executable, gmx.
So
```
editconf
```
now becomes
```
gmx editconf
```

The real main function is in src/programs/gmx.cpp.

All executables, such as `editconf` and `mdrun`, are now modules
that are added in `src/programs/legacymodules.cpp`.

For example, in the function `registerLegacyModules(&manager)`
```
registerModule(manager, &gmx_mdrun, "mdrun", "...");
```
enables `gmx mdrun`, which will call `gmx_mdrun(argc, argv)`,
which is defined in `src/programs/mdrun/mdrun.cpp`.

The sources of the modules distributed in

* `src/gromacs/gmxana`:         editconf, gmx_rms, gmx_wham, ...

* `src/gromacs/gmxpreprocess`:  pdb2gmx, grompp, solvate, ...

* `src/programs/mdrun`          mdrun, ...



Trajectory anaylsis tools
==========================


The simplest and relatively self-contained tool is probably `gmx_morph`
whose source code is `src/gromacs/gmx_morph.c`.

Another example is `gmx_gyrate`,
whose source code is `src/gromacs/gmx_gyrate.c`.



Separate mdrun
==============

However, mdrun can be compiled as a separate executable
as is done by src/programs/mdrun_main.cpp


int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    return gmx::CommandLineModuleManager::runAsMainCMain(argc, argv, &gmx_mdrun);
}
