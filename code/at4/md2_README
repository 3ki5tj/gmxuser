Notes
------
spb_dopro:   proline
spb_dogly:   glycine
spb_doter:   terminal

The following options are derived from an integer, premode,
    which is specified by the command line option of md2 as
      -atpre premode
    premode is 0 during a production run,
    or 1 in common preparation mode

spb_updstat: update data
             true if premode is an odd, false if even

spb_active:  apply a biased pmf for dihedrals
             true if premode == 0 or <= 8

spb_binref:  load reference distribution from spb.bin/pre.bin
             true if premode % 4 == 3 or 0,
             i.e., premode 0,  3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, ...

spb_initclr: clear data initially
             may be used to inspect de novo distribution
             true if premode > 0 and premode % 8 == 5, 6, 7, or 0
